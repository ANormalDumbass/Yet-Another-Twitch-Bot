# Yet-Another-Twitch-Bot
Yet Another Twitch Bot... But in Python!

This *not so usable* Python Script is used to connect to Twitch's API to create a simple Twitch Chat Bot. 

*This git repository was made not to be something actually serious, If you actually need something serious use another bot.*


**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.- Download every Python Script. 

2.- Run the *create settings txt file.py* script and fill the info asked. This creates a *settings.txt* file with all the info which *bot.py* uses.

3.- Run *bot.py* and test the bot. If it doesn't work for some reason, then contact me through discord (96_)
