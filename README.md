# Yet-Another-Twitch-Bot
Yet Another Twitch Bot... But in Python!

This *not so usable* Python Script is used to connect to Twitch's API to create a simple Twitch Chat Bot. 
*This git repository was made not to be something actually serious, If you actually need something serious use another bot.*
**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.- Download every Python Script. 
2.- Run the *create settings txt file.py* script, the code asks you for the name of the Bot, the Twitch Token of the Bot Account, the message which the bot should respond to (just like a command), the message you want the bot to send, and the name where the bot should connect to. Then creates a *settings.txt* file with all the info of earlier which *bot.py* uses.
3.- Run *bot.py* and test the bot. If it doesn't work for some reason, then contact me through discord (96_)
